The off-the-shelf knn classfier used was the one implemented in the R package \emph{'class'} written by Brian Ripley. The key settings used for this classification were - 
\begin{itemize}
		\item Preprocessing - Simple Scaling with Binning(same as classifier 3)
		\item Proximity Metric - (internal)
		\item Voting - (internal)
\end{itemize}
The classifier performed significantly better than any of our classifiers. The AUC peaked at $k=29$. The ROC curve at $k=29$ also rose sharply and then saturated at $FPR=0.6$. The AUC was greater than either of out classfiers. Finally the accuracy also rose quickly with threshold and reached a saturation at $0.8$.\\
