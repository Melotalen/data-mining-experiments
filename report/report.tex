%\begin{abstract}
%Recognition of objects using Deep Neural Networks is an active area of research and many breakthroughs have been made in the last few years. The paper attempts to indicate how far this field has progressed. The paper briefly describes the history of research in Neural Networks and describe several of the recent advances in this field. The performances of recently developed Neural Network Algorithm over benchmark datasets have been tabulated. Finally, some the applications of this field have been provided.
